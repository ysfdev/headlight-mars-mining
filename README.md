# Mars Mining Discovery Tournament

View the live application on: https://headlight-mars-service.herokuapp.com/

## My approach

I decided to build the App with ReactJS in combination Semantic UI for layout tooling and Redux and Redux Saga for the application state management, since this gives the application a good foundation for extending the basic functionality over time for more complex features on UI/UX.

## Tradeoffs I made

I decided to keep the mining data monitoring grid simple to only displaying nodes location's coordinates, due to time availability. But with more time I would've implemented a more informative layout, to include additional node details such as ID, claims, scores, etc...  

## Future Goals

- Modify the Mining Data Grid layout, to include more details information about nodes
- Include ability to switch among different data API's and view data from different data servers. 
- Implement unit and integration tests
- Make the UI mobile friendly
